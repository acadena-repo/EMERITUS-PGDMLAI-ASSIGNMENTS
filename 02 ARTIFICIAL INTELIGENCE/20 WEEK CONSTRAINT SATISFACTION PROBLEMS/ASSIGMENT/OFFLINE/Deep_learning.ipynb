    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment provides an opportunity to get used to *artificial neural networks* for supervised machine learning. We'll do this first by looking at the *perceptron* algorithm as an early example of a neural network. By building a simple program implementing the perceptron, you'll get a sense of the mathematical ideas underlying the training of neural networks. From there, you'll experiment with [Keras](https://keras.io/) as an example of a framework for building neural networks and solve a simple classification problem as well as a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also solve a few *Constraint Satisfaction Problems* by backtracking (including the famous $N$-Queens problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of the present assignment are to:\n",
    "+ Get used to the core terminology used with neural networks: layers, units, activation functions, etc.\n",
    "+ Implement the simplest neural network algorithm (the perceptron) to build a conceptual foundation on which neural networks are built.\n",
    "+ Solve som simple problems using a neural networks framework.\n",
    "+ Develop simple recursive functions for backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. **Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment.** Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client. \n",

    "> Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are mathematical questions defined as a set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations. CSPs represent the entities in a problem as a homogeneous collection of finite constraints over variables, which is solved by constraint satisfaction methods. CSPs are the subject of intense research in both artificial intelligence and operations research, since the regularity in their formulation provides a common basis to analyze and solve problems of many seemingly unrelated families. CSPs often exhibit high complexity, requiring a combination of heuristics and combinatorial search methods to be solved in a reasonable time. The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) and answer set programming (ASP) can be roughly thought of as certain forms of a constraint satisfaction problem."

In this problem, you are given a set of tuples of the form *(origin, destination)* where each ordinate in the tuple is an airport code. A starting airport is specifed, but the set of tuples is otherwise not provided in any particular sequence. The goal is to use the list of tuples (flights) provided to recover the sequence of airports visited in sequence making sure to exhaust every tuple in the set provided. Of course, this can be considered a graph teraversal problem where the nodes/vertices are the airports and the edges are the connecting flights.\n",
